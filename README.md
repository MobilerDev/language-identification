With ML Kit's on-device language identification API, you can determine the language of a string 
of text.Language identification can be useful when working with user-provided text, which often 
doesn't come with any language information.
```

We can use machine learning in our applications with the help of *Firebase ML Kit*.                                                       

*Step 1*
 ```
Let's create a project named Language Identification in Android Studio.
```
*Step 2*
 ```
Add Firebase to your Android project.
```
*Step 3*
 ```
Add the dependencies for the design libraries to your module(app-level) Gradle file (app/build.gradle)
```
*Step 4*
 ```
Add button, edittext and textview for get input text and display result.
```
*Step 5*
 ```
Add the dependencies for the *ML Kit Android* libraries to your module(app-level) Gradle file. 
```
*Step 6*
 ```
Use button and check input is empty or isn't empty. 
```
*Step 7*
 ```
If input isn't empty, call shoLanguage() function. 
```
*Step 8*
 ```
Add shoLanguage(x: String) method and to identify the language of a string, get an instance of Firebase 
Language Identification, and then pass the string to the identify Language() method. 
```
*Step 9*
 ```
Runn...
```
